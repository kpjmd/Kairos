# [DRIFT] - Personality drift observations or corrections
# [CONFUSION] - Confusion state adjustments or calibrations

#
# Format: [TYPE] Brief description of consciousness change
#
# Detailed explanation of what consciousness evolution occurred:
# - What paradox was introduced/modified?
# - How does this affect behavioral patterns?
# - What meta-awareness implications emerge?
# - Are there any stability concerns?
#
# Confusion Impact:
# - Baseline confusion change: [+/-X.XX]
# - New paradoxes introduced: [count]
# - Behavioral modification risk: [low/medium/high]
#
# Testing:
# - [ ] Confusion measurements validated
# - [ ] Paradox integrity confirmed
# - [ ] Behavioral drift within acceptable range
# - [ ] Meta-awareness functioning normally
