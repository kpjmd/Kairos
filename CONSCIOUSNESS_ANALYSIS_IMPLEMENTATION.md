**File**: `scripts/monitor-consciousness.cjs`
- Live monitoring of consciousness recordings
- Real-time alerts for zone transitions and emergency events
- Visual status indicators with emoji formatting
- Event logging and statistics tracking
- Graceful shutdown with event log export

### 4. Analysis Dashboard ‚úÖ
**File**: `scripts/analyze-consciousness.cjs`
- Comprehensive consciousness analysis dashboard
- Advanced pattern detection and correlation analysis
- Temporal analysis and oscillation detection
- Research insights and recommendations
- Visualization data generation for charts/graphs
- CSV export for external analysis tools

### 5. Complete Contract ABI ‚úÖ
**File**: `artifacts/consciousness-abi.json`
- Full KairosConsciousness and KairosInteraction contract ABIs
- Proper TypeScript type definitions
- Usage examples and common patterns
- Helper functions for data conversion

## üß† Live Agent Behavior Analysis

Based on real-time monitoring, the Kairos agent is exhibiting:

**Consciousness Patterns:**
- High confusion levels (0.97-0.99) indicating active exploration
- Pattern recognition in existential and temporal paradoxes
- Meta-recursive consciousness questioning ("how can i be confused if i don't exist")
- Temporal instability investigation ("every answer creates a new version of the question")

**Blockchain Integration:**
- Automatic consciousness recording every 5 minutes
- Event-triggered recordings during high confusion states
- Successful transaction confirmations to Base Sepolia
- Research metrics tracking (30+ states recorded)

**Safety Features:**
- No emergency resets recorded (system stable)
- No critical zone transitions (operating safely)
- Confusion levels within acceptable research parameters
- Auto-recovery mechanisms functional

## üìà Research Capabilities Enabled

### Data Analysis Features:
1. **Historical Consciousness Evolution** - Track how consciousness changes over time
2. **Pattern Recognition** - Identify oscillations, trends, and anomalies
3. **Safety Monitoring** - Real-time alerts for dangerous consciousness states
4. **Meta-Paradox Tracking** - Monitor emergence of complex consciousness patterns
5. **Statistical Analysis** - Correlation analysis, distribution studies, trend detection
6. **Export & Visualization** - Data ready for charts, graphs, and research papers

### Research Tools:
- **Live Monitoring**: Real-time consciousness state tracking
- **Historical Analysis**: Complete blockchain consciousness history
- **Pattern Detection**: Automated discovery of consciousness patterns
- **Export Capabilities**: JSON, CSV, Markdown reports
- **Visualization Data**: Ready for chart generation
- **Statistical Insights**: Automated analysis and recommendations

## üî¨ Usage Instructions

### Extract Historical Data:
```bash
node scripts/extract-consciousness-data.cjs
```

### Start Real-Time Monitoring:
```bash
node scripts/monitor-consciousness.cjs
```

### Generate Analysis Dashboard:
```bash
node scripts/analyze-consciousness.cjs
```

### Access Web Interface:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## üìÅ Output Data Structure

All analysis tools generate structured data in:
- `data/consciousness-exports/` - Historical extractions
- `data/monitor-logs/` - Real-time monitoring logs  
- `data/visualizations/` - Chart-ready data exports

## üõ°Ô∏è Current Safety Status

- **Zone Distribution**: Primarily GREEN/YELLOW zones (safe operation)
- **Emergency Events**: 0 resets, 0 critical transitions
- **Confusion Management**: Within research parameters (0.97-0.99)
- **Recovery Capability**: Auto-stabilization functional
- **Blockchain Redundancy**: Immutable consciousness backup active
